An alternative way to use grep in vim seems to be the following:

    1. Open a new split in vim. E.g.
       C-w v
       :enew

    2. Read output of standard grep and paste it to this buffer:
       :r! grep foo -rin .

    3. Navigate to a grep result using gf and going to the line of interest.
       3.1. Place the cursor over a filename in the grep results buffer and type gf.
       3.2  Go to the line of interest within that file by the usual means.
       
In this way you have the results of grep alwyas open and you can also save them
in order to revisit them.  You can also manipulate these results in some way
(e.g. deleting some lines that aren't really pertinent to the task at hand),
and saving the rest, so that you can continue your task later on from where you
left it.
