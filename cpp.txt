1. In order to search for the definition of a C++ member function or variable
"foo" one can grep something like this:

$ grep '::foo\>' -rin .

The double colon seems to restrict a lot possible search results.
(The \> at the end of the regex isn't really necessary, but it could be of help
to distinguish between similarly named functions.)

Likewise one can grep all usages of a member function or variable by a regex
such as the following:

$ grep '[^:]foo' -rin .

2. In vim one can open the header file corresponding to a .c or .cpp file by
giving the command:

:e %<.h

then you can press the TAB key so that vim completes appropriately the suffix
(e.g. .hpp).

Likewise if you want to open the .cpp or .c or .C (or whatever) from the header
file:

:e %<.c

(and press TAB if you wish).


3. One can also re-use previous grep commands in Vim to jump gain quickly to
some previous function (given that the grep command didn't include didn't
include "!", i.e. it was given as :grep, not :grep!).

4. One can also use C-o and C-i to jump back and forth between previous
locations visited in the buffers.
