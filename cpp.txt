In order to search for the definition of a C++ member function or variable "foo" one can grep something like this:

$ grep '::foo\>' -rin .

The double colon seems to restrict a lot possible search results.

Likewise one can grep all usages of a member function or variable by a regex such as the following:
$ grep '[^:]foo' -rin .
